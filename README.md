# TheHuzz Optimization Project

## Overview
The **TheHuzz Optimization Project** focuses on enhancing **hardware fuzzing efficiency** through **dynamic mutation and feedback-driven fuzzing**. By refining the mutation engine, the project improves coverage while reducing runtime, enabling more effective vulnerability detection in hardware verification. A key contribution is the development of an **effectiveness-checking algorithm**, which optimizes mutation strategies by identifying and eliminating redundant mutations, leading to more targeted and efficient test case generation.

## Features
- **Dynamic Mutation & Feedback-Driven Fuzzing**: Adapts to test results to improve coverage and reduce redundant operations.
- **Effectiveness-Checking Algorithm**: Enhances mutation strategies by minimizing redundancy and increasing test efficiency.
- **Optimized Mutation Engine**: Improves hardware fuzzing performance through adaptive mutation techniques.
- **Benchmarking & Validation**: Tested against existing verification methods at the **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** on **open-source processors** within a **Linux environment**.
- **Increased Coverage**: Achieves up to a **7.95% improvement** in hardware verification coverage.

## Benchmarking & Results
The optimized mutation engine was benchmarked against standard verification methods, demonstrating:
- **Reduction in redundant mutations**, leading to faster and more efficient fuzzing.
- **Enhanced test coverage**, resulting in more thorough hardware validation.
- **Improved runtime efficiency**, accelerating the verification process without compromising accuracy.
